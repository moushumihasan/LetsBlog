            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
			Lets Blog instantly connects people everywhere to what is most meaningful to them. Any registered user can send a blog, which is a message of 140 characters or less that is public by default and can include other content like and comment on the blog.<br/><br/>
			What you say on Lets Blog may be viewed all around the world instantly.<br/><br/>
			This Privacy Policy describes how and when Lets Blog collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services. Lets Blog receives your information through our website applications and widgets (the "Services" or "Lets Blog"). For example, you send us information when you use Lets Blog from our website, post or from an application such as Lets Blog for Mac or Lets Blog for Android. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Lets Blog to use your information in the United Kingdom and any other country where Lets Blog operates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
			<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br/><br/>
			We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.<br/> <br/><br/>
            Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Lets Blog account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, password and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.<br/><br/><br/>
            Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Lets Blog may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
 			<br/><br/><br/>
 			Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Lets Blog account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Lets Blog button or widget. Lets Blog uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.<br/><br/><br/>
 			Third-Parties: Lets Blog uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in Lets Blog account settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads.
 			<br/><br/><br/><br/>
 			<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b><br/><br/><br/>
 			Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Lets Blog account.
 			<br/><br/>
 			Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United Kingdom and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
 			<br/><br/>
 			Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Lets Blog's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government, request to disclose your information.
 			<br/><br/>
 			Business Transfers: In the event that Lets Blog is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
